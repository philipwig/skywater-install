You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 2056b37 Yesterday's commit surfaced two errors in series;  this fixes the second one of them, which is a failure to change CurrentTail when an extra (implicit) pin was added to the last component in the current cell, resulting in the failure of Node() to add the new no-connect node, which instead overwrites the pin just created.
config.status: WARNING:  'defs.mak.in' seems to ignore the --datarootdir setting
